# Pettiness Analyzer

Ever wondered if your daily frustrations are legitimate or just a tad... petty? Let Gemma, our AI-powered pettiness judge, decide!

This fun, single-page React application takes your grievances, sends them to the Google Gemini API for a humorous analysis, and gives you a "pettiness score" from 0 to 100, complete with a witty judgment and some questionable advice. (Note this was Heavily and i mean heavily inspired by an Artifact on Claude, but I made some changes to the theme and of course the model used since I don't have the ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’µ to pay for a claude API key)

Check out a fully working version of it deployed to vercel on: https://my-pettiness-app.vercel.app/

    This project requires a Google Gemini API key to function.
    *   In the root of your project directory, create a new file named `.env`.
